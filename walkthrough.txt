BASIC INSTALLATION

- https://www.anaconda.com/download/success -- Download for your operating system.
	- skip registration -- it is not needed
- follow the setup process. Keep all things as default, unless you really want to save your anaconda distribution to some special place.
- search for 'anaconda prompt' on your computer.

MAKING A VENV FOR PRACTICUM MODULES

- make a folder in some directory and name it INSPIRE. 
- navigate to that folder.
- make a venv and notice where the environment will be stored: "environment location: C:\Users\wular\anaconda3\envs\inspire24"

CREATE THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
conda create --name inspire24 # create the conda env
conda activate inspire24      # activate the conda env (note that the beginning of the prompt will have the env name)

DOWNLOADING MODULES IN THE VENV
conda install -c conda-forge openmm
conda install -c conda-forge mdanalysis
conda install -c conda-forge nglview
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=inspire24 # install this venv kernel

USING THE NOTEBOOKS

# cloning the github repository to the local folder so that we have everything
- in the anaconda prompt, navigate to your inspire folder (if not already there)
- git clone URLURL, where URLURL is taken from the github url (green code button)
- verify that the github repository was downloaded to the local directory

# open up a local instance of jupyter
- we will use jupyter notebook since that is a good balance between having a pseudo presentation along with the code
- open the anaconda navigator.
- select to launch a jupyter notebook. the notebook will appear in a web browser.
- navigate to your inspire folder and the sub-directory containing Eugene's lecture
- open the jupyter notebook that contains the lecture
- make sure that you've selected the inspire24 kernel for use in the notebook

# download chimerax for visualization
- navigate to, and download, ChimeraX (https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax/download.html) for molecular visualization.
