    "\n",
    "The goal of today's lecture is to present an introduction of the simulation technique called Molecular Dynamics (MD), as applied to macromolecules. We will learn how to run these simulations using the Python programmming language. We will use many `numpy` functions and a few new modules, such as `openmm` for MD simulations. These are the important concepts that we will cover:\n",

    "Newton's 2nd law connects the kinematics (movements) of a body with its mechanics (total force acting on it) and defines the dynamic evolution of its position: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$m\\frac{d^2r(t)}{dt^2} = F = - \\nabla{U(r)},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ is the mass, $r$ is the position, $F$ is the force and $U(r)$ is the potential energy, which depends only on the position of the body. \n",
    "If one knows the forces acting upon the body, one can find the position of the body at any moment $r(t)$, i.e. predict its dynamics. This can be done by solving Newton's equation of motion. It is a second order ODE that can be solved analytically for a few simple cases: constant force, harmonic oscillator, periodic force, drag force, etc.\n",
    "However, a more general approach is to use computers in order to solve the ODE numerically. Predicting dynamics gives us a powerful tool to study nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Simulation of Dynamics of Particles <a id='l_sims'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [many methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_methods_for_ordinary_differential_equations#Methods) for solving ODEs. The second order ODE is transformed to the system of two first order ODEs as follows:\n",

    "[Protein structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure) is the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a protein, which is a chain of amino acids. Proteins are polymers – specifically polypeptides – formed from sequences of 20 types of amino acids, the monomers of the polymer. A single amino acid monomer may also be called a residue, indicating a repeating unit of a polymer. To be able to perform their biological function, proteins fold into one or more specific spatial conformations driven by a number of non-covalent interactions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- hydrogen bonding \n",
    "- ionic interactions \n",
    "- Van der Waals forces\n",
    "- hydrophobic packing \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the functions of proteins at a molecular level, it is often necessary to determine their three-dimensional structure using techniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Levels of structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary structure** of a protein refers to the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary structure** refers to highly regular local sub-structures of the actual polypeptide backbone chain. There are two main types of secondary structure: the α-helix and the β-strand or β-sheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tertiary structure** refers to the three-dimensional structure of monomeric and multimeric protein molecules. The α-helixes and β-sheets are folded into a compact globular structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Quaternary structure** is the three-dimensional structure consisting of two or more individual polypeptide chains (subunits) that operate as a single functional unit (multimer).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Antibodies* - bind to specific foreign particles, ex: IgG \n",
    "- *Enzymes* - speed up chemical reactions, ex: Lysozyme\n",
    "- *Messengers* - transmit signals, ex: Growth hormone \n",
    "- *Structural components* - support for cells, ex: Tubulin\n",
    "- *Transport/storage* - bind and carry small molecules, ex: Hemoglobin\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lysozyme** is a protein-enzyme (found in tears, saliva, mucus and egg white) that is a part of the innate immune system with antimicrobial activity characterized by the ability to damage the cell wall of bacteria. Bacteria have polysaccharides (sugars) in their cell wall, that bind to the groove, and lysozyme cuts the bond and destroys bacteria.  \n",

Run 3 simulations of fully extended polyglycine `data/polyGLY.pdb` for 1 nanosecond (where water is described implicitly) at $T_1=200 K$, $T_2=300 K$, and $T_3=400 K$ and visually compare initial and the final structure at each temperature. Perform a quantitative analysis of the trajectories you obtained in Exercise 3. Use, for example, the end-to-end distance and the function `radius_of_gyration()` from the `MDAnalysis` module, which returns the [radius of gyration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_of_gyration) of the protein. Describe the dependence of folding rate on the temperature. Explain."
